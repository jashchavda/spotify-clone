Layout and Structure:

Start by designing the layout of your Spotify clone. You'll need a header, a main content area for displaying albums, playlists, and songs, and a player bar at the bottom for controlling playback.
Use HTML to structure these elements accordingly.
Styling with CSS:

Apply CSS to style your layout. You'll want to use Spotify's color scheme and typography to give your clone a familiar look.
Utilize CSS for responsive design, ensuring your clone looks good on different screen sizes.

Also used javascript for playing music and  other functions.
